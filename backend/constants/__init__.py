PROJECTS
Toyota Autonomous Vehicle Robot
•	Developed autonomous control algorithms for a TurtleBot using Python, ROS2, and Ubuntu, enabling real-time navigation and obstacle avoidance. Integrated LiDAR sensors for dynamic environmental mapping and YOLOv8 for enhanced stop sign detection, improving accuracy by 50%. Leveraged Gazebo simulations for real-world validation, while utilizing the command line in a Linux VM to streamline operations.
•	Engineered a modular, maintainable codebase by applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, maximizing scalability and code reuse. Followed the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and used Git for version control to ensure effective collaboration. 

Tennis Match Analysis System
•	Enhanced the accuracy of a pretrained YOLOv8 model for tennis ball detection from 33% to over 75% by training on a Roboflow dataset in Google Colab. The model tracked player movement and calculated metrics such as average speed, distance covered, ball speed, and rally length from both images and videos.
•	Developed a mini-court visualization of tennis matches, showcasing player movement and ball coverage using algorithms, enabling 3D frame data to be read on a 2D plane. Utilized PyTorch to create a Convolutional Neural Network for detecting tennis court landmarks such as serve boxes, double alleys, and center court lines.

Real-Time Chat Application
•	Developed a real-time chat application with Next.js 13, MongoDB, and Socket.io to enable messaging between users. Leveraged Pusher to enhance real-time communication capabilities, augmenting the application with efficient data synchronization and instant updates. 
•	Utilized Socket.io's scalable architecture to support connectivity across multiple servers. Key features included one-on-one messaging, group chat rooms, presence tracking, and typing indicators. 
•	Integrated a MongoDB database for persistent user data, chat history, and presence tracking. Authentication handled sign-up and login workflows using NextAuth. App deployed to production utilizing modern technologies stack.

Tower Defense Python Game 
•	Developed and implemented a machine learning model using Python to accurately predict tomorrow's S&P 500 index price based on historical data obtained through the yfinance package. Conducted data cleaning and preprocessing tasks using pandas, resulting in a dataset comprising over 10 years of S&P 500 index price data.
•	Employed advanced methodologies to mitigate common issues such as overfitting, including rigorous back testing procedures and feature engineering techniques. This comprehensive approach resulted in a model with an improved accuracy rate of 60% and showcased a deep understanding of machine learning principles.

Autonomous Robot
• Built a fully autonomous Arduino robot integrated with light, distance, and motion sensors, and a 3D printed a real-time custom wireless controller featuring dual joysticks, buttons, LEDs, and a switch.
• Programmed an Arduino Nano and Uno to drive motors, read sensors, and facilitate bidirectional RF communication between robot and controller using NRF24L01 modules.
• Designed the robot and its controller using AutoCAD and SolidWorks, leveraging advanced 3D modeling techniques to craft intricate mechanical structures and components with precision and industry level dimensioning.
